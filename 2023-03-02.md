# Organize the following:
	ASP .NET Core:
	-IFormFile and file storing.
	-HttpContext encapsulate the http request and the http response 
	-MiddleWares is the way of handlling the http request that comes from the front.
	-each middleWare has a specifc responsiblity which plays togather under the chain
	of responsibilty design pattern.
	-the responsibilty of the middlewares actally is handlling the cross-cutting
	concerns
	-after the middlewars there is another pipeline which handle specific concerns
	called filtering 
	so in general 
	ASP .NET Core is a framework for building applications one of them is web
	application:
	Web application contains frontend "browser" and the "backend" server and the ASP
	.NET Core facilitate the Communication between them 
	so that it provide a way to process the request and the response between them.
	Middleware is the pipleline that all the request and the response should go throw.
	Filters is another pipeline that specific request goes throw base on some
	criterias.
	----------------------
	Secureity Context:
	Contains all the information that a user
	for security purposes that includes user infromation like email addresses 
	thoses informations are actually encapsulated within one single object called
	claim
	principal
	-the Principle Object  actually represent the security context which actually
	represent
	the user.
	- the principle contains one or many identity
	because one user can has multiple identities 
	for example student card and driver license.
	- one identity can contains many claims 
	which is a key value pair.
