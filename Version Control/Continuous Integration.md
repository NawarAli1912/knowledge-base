Continuous Integration, or CI, is used to automate the integration of code changes from multiple developers into a single main stream. Using a workflow whereby small changes are merged frequently, often many times per day, will reduce the number of merge conflicts.

This process is widespread in test-driven software development strategies. CI is often used to automatically compile the project and run tests on every code change to ensure that the build remains stable and prevent regressions in functionality.
