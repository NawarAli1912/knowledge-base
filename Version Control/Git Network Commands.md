- Clone- Copies a remote repository
- Fetch- Retrieves new objects and references from the remote repository ![[fetch-a.png]]
- Pull- Fetches and merges commits locally ![[pull-a.png]] ![[pull-b.png]]
- Push- Adds new objects and references to the remote repository
  git push [ —u] [ < repository>] [<branch>]
  -u Track this branch (--set-upstream)
- pull or fetch is recommended before pushing the push will fail if we don't have the latest updates 
- If you're worried about a pull creating an unwanted merge commit, you can use the ff only option.
