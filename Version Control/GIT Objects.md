- internally git uses objects to store 4 types of things:
	- commit object : a small text files contains the user information message a reference to the commit parent(s) and reference to the root tree of the project
	- Annotated tag : a reference to a specific commit
	- Tree : a list of a file names and directories in the project
	- Blob : the content of a file in the project
- a typical git user interacts with only the first two objects.
